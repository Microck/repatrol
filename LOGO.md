# Logo Prompts for Repatrol

**Project Context**: Multi-agent AI game testing system where autonomous agents (Explorer, Chaos, Reporter) play games to find bugs, capture video evidence, and file GitHub issues.

**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, modern, intelligent, developer-focused

**Key Concepts**: Patrol/guarding, swarm/intelligence, bug detection, gaming, automation

## Recommended Color Palette

Since no existing brand colors are defined, consider these options:

**Primary Options:**
- **Deep Blue** `#1E3A5F` - Trust, reliability, technical
- **Electric Teal** `#0D9488` - Modern, AI, innovation
- **Indigo** `#4F46E5` - Developer tools, technical, premium

**Accent Options:**
- **Amber** `#F59E0B` - Alert, bug detection, energy
- **Coral** `#EF4444` - Bug found, critical issue
- **Green** `#10B981` - Pass state, successful test

## Usage Notes

1. **Primary mark**: Use the geometric or monoline versions for main branding
2. **Favicon**: Tech-minimal grid or lettermark work well at small sizes
3. **Dark mode**: All prompts specified "centered on white" - for dark backgrounds, invert the one-color fill
4. **Variations**: The three-agent concept (Explorer, Chaos, Reporter) can be represented by three dots/nodes in any design
