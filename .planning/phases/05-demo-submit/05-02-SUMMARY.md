# Phase 5 Plan 2: Demo Run and Video Summary

**Demo automation now serves the local game, runs the full swarm, and produces `demo/video.mp4` from deterministic bug reproduction.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 19 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T23:58:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-16T00:17:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Added `run_demo.py` to serve local target and invoke orchestrator demo mode.
- Added `record_demo_video.py` to assert crash signal and convert recording to mp4.
- Verified `demo/video.mp4` generation with ffmpeg in headless flow.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Add deterministic full demo runner** - `72369cd` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add scripted demo video generator** - `a0c4ef0` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/run_demo.py` - local serve + orchestrator wrapper
- `scripts/record_demo_video.py` - deterministic recording + mp4 conversion
- `demo/video.mp4` - generated demo artifact

## Decisions Made

- Fail loudly when ffmpeg is missing so submission artifact generation is explicit.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

Install `ffmpeg` for mp4 conversion.

## Next Phase Readiness

Final documentation can now point to stable commands and generated demo assets.

## Self-Check: PASSED
