### Chaos Agent (CHAOS)

- [x] **CHAOS-01**: Chaos Agent performs random/adversarial inputs
- [x] **CHAOS-02**: Chaos Agent tries edge cases (overflow, rapid clicks)
- [x] **CHAOS-03**: Crash and hang detection
- [x] **CHAOS-04**: Bug state capture (screenshot + state)

### Reporting (REP)

- [x] **REP-01**: Reporter Agent synthesizes bug findings
- [x] **REP-02**: Video recording of bug reproduction
- [x] **REP-03**: GitHub issue creation with repro steps (dry-run verified; live token/repo gated)
- [x] **REP-04**: Screenshot/video evidence attached to issues

### Demo (DEMO)

- [x] **DEMO-01**: Test Orchestrator coordinates all agents
- [x] **DEMO-02**: At least 1 real bug found and filed (bug found; issue filing dry-run verified)
- [x] **DEMO-03**: 2-minute video showing bug discovery
- [x] **DEMO-04**: README with setup and results

## v2 Requirements

### Enhancements

- [ ] Regression Agent (replay known bug scenarios)
- [ ] Coverage heatmap visualization
- [ ] Game engine error log integration
- [ ] Multiple game support

---

## Out of Scope

- **3D games** — simple 2D/web game only
- **Multiple games** — single target for demo
- **Real-time streaming** — recorded sessions only
- **Regression Agent** — cut if time is short
- **Game engine integration** — external automation only
